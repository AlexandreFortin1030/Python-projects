    "12/02/01": "A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who achieves goals by non-standard means. The term has become associated in popular culture with a security hacker \u2013 someone with knowledge of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them. In a positive connotation, though, hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools (such as a VPN or the dark web) to mask their identities online and pose as criminals.[1][2] Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work. Hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra-legally and illegally by law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless espionage [or even sabotage] activities), and employed by state actors as a weapon of legal and illegal warfare.\n\nHacking can also have a broader sense of any roundabout solution to a problem, or programming and hardware development in general (see hackathon), and hacker culture has spread the term's broader usage to the general public, even outside the profession or hobby of electronics (see life hack). \n",
    "12/02/20": "h The hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy\u2014often in collective effort\u2014the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming the limitations of software systems or electronic hardware (mostly digital electronics), to achieve novel and clever outcomes.[1] The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media[2]) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed hacking. However, the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), but how it is done[3] and whether it is exciting and meaningful.[2] Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have \"hack value\" and therefore the term \"hacks\" came about,[3] with early examples including pranks at MIT done by students to demonstrate their technical aptitude and cleverness. The hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC)[4] and MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[5] Hacking originally involved entering restricted areas in a clever way without causing any major damage. Some famous hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome and converting the Great Dome into R2-D2.[6]\n\nRichard Stallman explains about hackers who program:\n\n    What they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show \"Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done.\"[7]\n"
